My way of automating _Windows_ system setup and personalization

This repository contains:
- Scripts for system configuration (modifying registries, removing junk etc.)
- Scripts for system personalization (localization, date & time formatting, power settings, context menus / shell handlers, default explorer views etc.)
- Scripts for installing various applications
- Application-specific configuration files (in a similar fashion to dotfiles)

Use at your own risk
