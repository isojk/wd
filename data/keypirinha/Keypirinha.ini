# Application's main section.

# Should Keypirinha be launched when Windows starts?
# * It is the only setting that requires access to the Windows Registry.
# * If this value is false (or changed to false at runtime), the application
#   will always try to automatically unregister itself.
# * The following registry key is used by Keypirinha:
#   * Key: HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run\
#   * Value name: Keypirinha
# * Default: no
launch_at_startup = yes

# Hotkey to show/hide (toggle) the LaunchBox.
# * String must be formated that way: <modifiers> + <virtual_key>
# * <modifiers> can be one or several of the following modifier keys:
#   Alt, Ctrl, Shift, Win.
# * <virtual_key> can be:
#   * One of the following special keys:
#     Minus, Plus, Backspace, Tab, Return (or Enter), Pause, Escape (or Esc),
#     Space, PageUp (or PgUp), PageDown (or PgDown), End, Home, Left, Up, Right,
#     Down, Print, Insert, Ins, Delete, Del, NumLock, ScrollLock (or Scroll),
#     F1 to F24, and Numpad0 to Numpad9.
#   * Or a character from the main part of your keyboard. I.e. excluding the
#     numpad and the special keys enumerated above.
#     Note that not every typed character will work, see the "IMPORTANT" notice
#     below.
# * Examples: "Alt+Space", "Ctrl+Shift+Plus", "Ctrl+Alt+3", "Ctrl+Win+W",
#   "Ctrl+Alt+F2", "Shift+Alt+Return" (without quotes)
# * Note that while the "Win+<virtual_key>" form is possible, it is discouraged
#   by Microsoft as a given combination might be "reserved" for future use.
#   I.e.: a combination that works now may not be usable with future releases of
#   the OS.
# * IMPORTANT: some combinations won't trigger any error at registration time
#   but just won't work when pressed. In that special case, it is not possible
#   for Keypirinha to know if a hotkey actually does its job so you are on your
#   own and you'll probably have to choose another combination.
#   In any other case of error, a message dialog will pop up to inform you
#   something went wrong.
# * Default: Ctrl+Win+K
hotkey_run = Alt+F2


[gui]
# Section dedicated to the Graphical User Interface (GUI)

# The width of the LaunchBox, in percent of the full width of the monitor
# * Ignored if "geometry" setting is set to "persistent"
# * Accepted range is [5, 100]
# * The LaunchBox has a hard-coded minimum width of 400 pixels so the auto_width
#   may not always be honored for small values, depending on the width of the
#   monitor
# * Default: 33
auto_width = 50

# Should the LaunchBox be always on top of other windows when displayed?
# * Type: Boolean
# * Default: no
always_on_top = no

# Should the LaunchBox automatically hide when it loses focus and how?
# * Accepted values:
#   * immediate: The LaunchBox will automatically and immediately hide when it
#     loses focus.
#   * delayed: The LaunchBox will hide after a small delay if it loses focus.
#     This value can come handy to help prevent losing your search state in case
#     an application inadvertently takes over the focus before releasing it.
#     Note that you may prefer the 'immediate' mode if you have enabled the
#     retain_last_search option below.
#   * no: The LaunchBox won't hide automatically
# * Type: Enum
# * Default: no
hide_on_focus_lost = immediate

[external]
# Section dedicated to the setup of external applications launched by Keypirinha
# or the packages.

# The text editor to invoke when the "Edit" action of an item is triggered
# * By default (empty value), Keypirinha will try to invoke your system's Edit
#   verb when available.
# * See also the "config_editor" setting below.
# * CAUTION: This value is expected to be a valid command line! That is, if the
#   path to your executable or any other argument contains whitespaces, it must
#   be double-quoted.
# * Special behavior with known editors:
#   Keypirinha will take advantages of the available command line options
#   offered by some recognized editors:
#   * Notepad2 and variants: enable a more convenient layout when editing
#     several files at the same time.
#   * SublimeText and Atom: also open package's directory when editing package
#     configuration files.
# * The "editor_accepts_multifiles" value indicates if the editor accepts
#   multiple files on the command line. For example, for very simple editors
#   like Notepad, this value should be set to "no" (without quotes), but for
#   MDI-style editors (Multiple Document Interface) like Notepad++ and
#   SublimeText, this value may be set to "yes".
# * Examples:
#     editor = notepad.exe
#     editor = "${env:SYSTEMROOT}\notepad.exe"
#     editor = "${env:EDITOR}"
#     editor = "C:\Program Files\FooEditor\editor.exe" -open
editor = "C:\Program Files\Microsoft VS Code\Code.exe"
editor_accepts_multifiles = yes

# The text editor to specifically edit Keypirinha's configuration files
# * Possible configurations:
#   * If this value is defined, it must be of the same format than for the
#     "editor" setting
#   * A NON-COMMENTED (i.e. defined) and EMPTY value forces Keypirinha to use
#     the bundled Notepad2-mod editor to edit its configuration files
#   * A COMMENTED (i.e. undefined) value means you want to rely on the "editor"
#     setting to edit Keypirinha's configuration files as well
config_editor = "C:\Program Files\Microsoft VS Code\Code.exe"
config_editor_accepts_multifiles = yes
